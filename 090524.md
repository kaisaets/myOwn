``` java
Easy: 
Fill the 5x5 array with numbers from 1 to 25
1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10
...
But you have to use for loop to fill it up automatically.
```
```java
Easy: Fill the array with random digits from 0 to 9
```
```java
Medium: 
1. Fill up every second row with value 1
2. Fill up every second column with value 1
```
```java

Hard: 
1. Hide a number 10 in the array somewhere
2. Do not print out the values immediately
3. ask the user for the row and column and then tell them the value that was found
4. Make them repeat until they find 10
```
